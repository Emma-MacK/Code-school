# from a fasta file, read in sequences, calculate GC%
# return ID of sequence with highest GC content

# read in modules

# create functions
# Read in fasta, separating when encountering a <
# count total number of bases
# count G and G bases in sequences, store based on ID

# Maybe have for loop, going over given sequences
# first sequence stored into objects
# if next object has higher GC, replace original ID and GC
# once through all sequences, return highest sequence.
